** Must have truffle and ganache and drizzle ... will add in installation instructions in a little bit**

I will update this README to be prettier closer to the due date. :)

To run:

`cd` into `backend` and run `ganache-cli`

in another tab, `cd` into `backend` directory and do `truffle compile` then `truffle migrate --reset`

`cd` into `frontend` in another tab and run `npm start` -- if this fails, try `npm install` and then `npm start`

Make sure MetaMask is installed in your browser (Chrome preferred), and make sure you've added an account via one of the private keys provided by `ganache-cli` in your `ganache-cli` tab.
