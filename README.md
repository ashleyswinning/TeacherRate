** Must have truffle and testrpc.. if unsure, run `npm install -g truffle` and `npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc`**

I will update this README to be prettier closer to the due date. :)

To run:

`cd` into `backend` and run `ganache-cli`

in another tab, `cd` into `backend` directory and do `truffle compile` then `truffle migrate --reset`

`cd` into `frontend` in another tab and run `npm start` -- if this fails, try `npm install` and then `npm start`
